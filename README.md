# MysteryDrop- An anonymous Message Dashboard with Next.js

This project is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to create

incorporates user authentication using `next-auth`, and styling is managed with
Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI and database managed with MongoDB.

   - Others can use the unique URL to send anonymous messages without requiring
     authentication.

4. **Message Control:**

   - Users have the option to stop receiving new messages by clicking a "flag"
     button on the dashboard.

5. **Authentication:**

   - User authentication is managed via `next-auth` for secure and seamless
     login/logout functionality.
